## Synopsis

Layers is a WordPress Theme framework focused on extending the WordPress core functionality to include layout building through the WordPress Visual Customizer. A lightweight set of base options, widgets and theme templates provide a user-friendly, extensible tool for creating beautiful, WordPress-faithful websites.

As a plugin, Layers is not intended for direct modification. Instead, it can be extended form a theme and it allows you to backup pages and widget data to create presets or “Style Kits” which you can share, sell, or use to seamlessly transfer setups and layouts from one install to another. Layers may also be extended through Child Themes and other Plugins via a growing set of hooks and filters.

Custom page layouts are achieved using the WordPress Customizer in combination with widgets.  You can access Layers customization from APPEARANCE → CUSTOMIZE or through any Layers Page.  These pages are listed under LAYERS → LAYERS PAGES for your convenience.

Customization of these pages and the overall theme is completed in the WordPress Customizer to take advantage of the live view.

## Page Builder

The core concept of Layers is to enable the user to build layouts using functionality that is native to WordPress. This page template simply provides a single widget area that is designed to work with the Layers Page Builder Widgets specifically, but can accomodate most any widget with a little custom styling.

## Page Templates

Layers bundles 6 basic page templates to allow sidebar specificity per page, and a standard blog feed which uses the Layers Site Settings sidebar selection.
